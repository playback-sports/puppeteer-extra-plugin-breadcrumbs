// Extend Puppeteer interfaces transparently to the end user.

// Note, we need to manually copy this file into the build dir (yarn ambient-dts): https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56018167
// Note2: It's not sufficient to just copy over this d.ts file, it needs to be referenced by another .ts file!
// Note3: To make it even more urgh the TS compiler will change the reference import path, hence we need to fix that in the end as well

// This import statement is important for all this to work, otherwise we don't extend but replace the puppeteer module definition.
